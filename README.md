# ADRION - Autonomous Defensive Reasoning Intelligence with Ontological Nexus

## Overview
ADRION is a sophisticated system architecture designed to handle complex information processing tasks efficiently. This document provides a high-level overview of its components and interactions.

## Components
1. **Input Module**: Responsible for gathering raw data from various sources.
2. **Processing Unit**: Core of the system where data analysis and decision-making occur.
3. **Output Module**: Delivers processed information to users or other systems.
4. **Storage**: A robust database system for storing both raw and processed data securely.
5. **User Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system, providing input and receiving outputs.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Trinity - Three Perspectives
- **Material**: Physical resources, energy, information
- **Intellectual**: Truth, elegance, good intent  
- **Essential**: Unity, harmony, purpose

### 2. Hexagon - Six Execution Modes
Sequential flow: Inventory → Empathy → Process → Debate → Healing → Action

### 3. Guardians - Nine Ethical Laws
1. Unity (Common good)
2. Truth (Integrity)
3. Rhythm (Balance)
4. Causality (Documentation)
5. Transparency (Clarity)
6. Nonmaleficence (Harm prevention)
7. Autonomy (Consent)
8. Justice (Fairness)
9. Sustainability (Long-term impact)

## Architecture Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| AI-Binder | Zero-copy IPC magistrate |
| Genesis Record | Immutable blockchain-like log |
| Watchdog | Process monitoring and recovery |
| Message Bus | Pub-sub communication system |
| Agent Swarm | Nine specialized agents |
| Skeptics Panel | Multi-temperature debate engine |

## EBDI Model - Emotional Intelligence

PAD Vector (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) regulates decision temperature:
- **Pleasure**: -1 (sad) to +1 (happy)
- **Arousal**: 0 (calm) to +1 (excited)
- **Dominance**: -1 (controlled) to +1 (empowered)

Temperature = max(0.1, 1.0 - (Arousal × (1 - Pleasure)))

## Performance Targets
- AI-Binder latency: < 10ms
- Message throughput: > 10k msgs/sec
- Full 369 decision flow: 4-6 seconds
- Dashboard load: < 2s
